        Walkin' with a dead man over my shoulder
        I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go
        Walkin' with a dead man over my shoulder
        Waiting for an invitation to arrive
        Goin' to a party where no one's still alive
        Waiting for an invitation to arrive
        Goin' to a party where no one's still alive
        I was struck by lighting, walkin' down the street
        I was hit by something last night in my sleep
        It's a dead man's party who could ask for more?
        Everybody's comin', leave your body at the door
        Leave your body and soul at the door
        Don't run away it's only me
        Only me</b>

        Ooh ooh, waitin' for an invitation to arrive
        Ooh! Walkin' with a dead man, dead man (with a dead man)
        I got my best suit and my tie
        With a shiny silver dollar on either eye
        I hear the chauffeur comin' to my door
        Says there's room for maybe just one more
        I was struck by lighting, walkin' down the street
        I was hit by something last night in my sleep
        It's a dead man's party, who could ask for more?

        Leave your body and soul at the door</b>
